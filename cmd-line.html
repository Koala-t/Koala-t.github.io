		<h1>The Command Line</h1>

		<p>People used the Command Line Interface to navigate around their computer files</p>
		<p>The command line interface (CLI) let users type in text commands for the computer to carry out.</p>	
		<p>It can still be used today and any programmer worth their salt knows how to get around using it</p>
