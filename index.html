			<h1>Basic web-development resource warehouse</h1>
			<p>What follows is a very bare-bones website.
			It's just HTML, there won't be any CSS even.</p>
			<p>On the upside that means that it should be a good example to learn the basics from!</p>

			<p>Here is a <a href="http://tutorialzine.com/2014/09/50-awesome-tools-and-resources-for-web-developers/">website</a> which is similar to this one. It covers more advanced topics and has links to more resources. It has broken the resources into categories which is good but there is no way to find out what categories there are besides scrolling for a while. This site could benifit from a navigation menu near the top.</p>
