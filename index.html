			<h3>The ultimate in chicken dinner:</h3>
			<p>Who doesn't love chicken? It's the one food that tastes like everything so if you like anything, you probably like chicken. It's just a question of wether the bird is dry and chewey or bursting with flavor and juices. This is how you make a delicious bird every time with minimal effort:</p>
			<ul>
				<h4>First of all you will need:</h5>
				<li>One whole chicken</li>
				<li>some salt</li>
				<li>olive oil</li>
				<li>herbs-de-provence</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This recepie only has one uncommon ingredient, the herbs-de-provence but trust me, you'll want some in your cabinet. It's a mix of savory, marjoram, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and sometimes lavender. It's like the vowels of spices.</p>
			<h4>Step-by-step:</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Start by preheating your oven to 450 degrees farenheit.</li>
				<li>Rinse off your chicken and pat it dry with paper towels, inside and out. If the skin isn't dry it wont get crispy!</li>
				<li>Lay the chicken in a roasting pan and sprinkle a large pinch of salt and a couple pinches of the herbs over the chicken</li>
				<li>Pour some oil on it (only a couple of tablespoons worth). Rub the oil all over the chicken using your hands spreading the spices as you go. Don't be afraid to get messy! Cover the entire surface, top and bottom.</li>
				<li>Pop the chicken in the oven and leave it alone for 50-60 minutes</li>
				<li>use a thermometer to check that it is 165 degrees or cut it open to check if the meat is still pink.</li>
				<li>Once it's cooked let it sit for 15 minutes before carving it up if you can.</li>
				<li>serve it with any veggies and starch you like. I prefer the classic brocolli and rice.</li>
			</ol>
