			<p>Here is a <a href="http://tutorialzine.com/2014/09/50-awesome-tools-and-resources-for-web-developers/">website</a> which is similar to this one. It covers more advanced topics and has links to more resources. It has broken the resources into categories which is good but there is no way to find out what categories there are besides scrolling for a while. This site could benifit from a navigation menu near the top.</p>
